# springboot-thymeleaf-dynamic-web-security
 
 ## Introduction
 
 This is my assignment 2 of Funix about buiding an dynamic website skeleton but I redo using Spring Boot(with Spring MVC and Spring Security) and Thymeleaf
 
  ## Version
 
-	Java 12
-	Spring Tool Suite 4 (Version: 4.3.2.RELEASE) 
-	Maven (version 3.6.1)
-	Tomcat (version 9.0.22) but not included in this assignment. As a result please download yourself 
-	Bootstrap (version 4.3.1)
- Other components are used according to “pom.xml” in each project

## How to install
please import as a maven project

## Project detail
-	This time spring project is what it meant to be: Spring boot , Spring Mvc , Spring Security and Thymeleaf. This just for Thymeleaf practice , no more no less 
-	Actually for Java code this is the same with the [spring boot code above](https://github.com/JimmyYouhei/springboot-jsp-dynamic-web-skeleton)

## Possible issue
-	Minimal testing and only follow Funix requirement. And not yet trying to break the system by myself so there maybe bug outside of Funix Requirement

## Known Issue
-	Bad front-end design: I hate graphic design so please
